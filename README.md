# Algebra-1-and-Geometry-TI-84-Programs
This is a collection of TI-84+ programs that I coded, it is comprised of mostly formulas along with a variation on the game pong. Their purpose is meant to be for reviewing and checking answers in high school level Algebra 1 and Geometry classes.<br>
Here is a list of the programs available as of 5/13/22:<br>
Areaequi: This program finds the area of an equilateral triangle and the regular hexagon formed. There is a sqrt(3) in this program so it is advised to divide by sqrt(3) in order to get an exact answer rather than a decimal approximation.<br>
Cyllinde: This program finds the volume, lateral surface area, and total surface area of a cyllinder. Pi is in the equation so it is advised to divide by pi in order to get an exact answer rather than a decimal approximation.<br>
Distance: This program find the distance between two points on a 2d coordinate plane. In this program ("A") refers to the second x coordinate, and ("B") refers to the second y coordinate.<br>
Frustum: This program finds the volume, lateral surface area, and total surface area of a conical frustum. Pi is used in the program so it is advised to divide by pi in order to get an exact answer rather than an approximation.<br>
Midpoint: This program finds the midpoint between 2 points on a 2-d coordinate plane. In this program ("A") refers to the second x coordinate, and ("B") refers to the second y coordinate.<br>
Polygon: This program finds the area and perimeter of a regular polygon with any number of sides. In this program ("A") refers to the apothem.<br>
Pong: In this twist on the classic game try to survive as many rounds as possible by hitting the ball, the paddle is controlled by the up and down keys.<br>
Quadform: This program solves a quadratic equation in the form: AX^2 + BX + C = 0<br>
SPACEDIA: This program finds the length of a space diagonal of rectangular prism<br>
Sphere: This program finds the volume and total surface area of a sphere. Pi is used in the program so it is advised to divide by pi in order to recieve an exact answer rather than a decimal approximation.<br>
Trap: This program finds the area of a trapezoid. In this program ("D") refers to the upper base of the trapezoid<br>

Note: These programs are compatible for both Ti-84 Plus and Ti-84 Plus CE calculators.
